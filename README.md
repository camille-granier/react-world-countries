This project has been developped with React. I've been updating it with latest versions of packages like react-router-dom 6 for example.

Is uses the [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all](rest countries API) to display flags and informations about countries.

I followed a french tutoriel from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0X1Tl8aHtA](from scratch).

It is hosted on github pages
