This project has been developped with React. Iâ€™ve been updating it with latest versions of packages like react-router-dom 6 for example.

Is uses the [rest countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to display flags and informations about countries.

I followed a french tutoriel from [From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0X1Tl8aHtA).

It is hosted on github pages
