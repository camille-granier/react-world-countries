# react-world-countries

A react project using the [rest countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).

I use react hooks and react packages like react-router-dom. I also used Sass.

I used the tutorial made by [From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0X1Tl8aHtA)

hosted on github [here](https://camille-granier.github.io/react-world-countries/)
